# About
AI and Computer Vision engineer with experience in remote sensing, multimodal learning and real-time perception systems. I’ve contributed to academic publications and production-level pipelines, and I enjoy bridging research ideas into working solutions. I’m currently exploring more efficient architectures and solutions for ADAS, intelligent industriel textile machines and satellite imagery.
